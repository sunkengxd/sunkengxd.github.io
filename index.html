                    <p>
                        This is my personal website. Here you can find out
                        different sorts of stuff about me, what I've worked
                        on/am working right now, etc. It's been made due to
                        several reasons: I wanted to refurbish my HTML & CSS
                        knowledge, I wanted to finally make my own website and,
                        finally, I wanted to express myself by designing a
                        website that would suit me.

                    <p>
                        The way I see it, any piece of software should be devoid
                        of bloat. From a UI point of view, this means as few
                        visual components as necessary, all of which do their
                        own job, nothing more, nothing less. But such a software
                        should also be (at least somewhat) eye-pleasing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From a developer's point of view, software should at
                        least follow the well-known principles: DRY, KISS, etc.
                        This also means using modern tech for development. For
                        example, a web application created using Svelte makes
                        for an app that comes with minimum JS, is simple enough
                        to develop and, most importantly, tries to solve
                        problems that persist at the current moment of time in
                        the IT sphere. You can even use Svelte as an SSG!

                        As of Q2 2022, I stick to the following set of software, programming languages & tools:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frontend: Svelte & Tailwind;</li>
                            <li>Backend: Rust (fast execution), Python (fast development);</li>
                            <li>Desktop apps: Tauri;</li>
                            <li>Embedded: C, looking forward to migrating to Rust;</li>
                            <li>Anything else..?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I use Arch btw.</p>

                        Hi! My name is Victor, I like video games, coding,
                        exploring new stuff and beer. As you can tell by this
                        website's design, I also like reading books. I am also
                        pretty terse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I come from Moldova and speak English, Russian and 
                        Romanian. Currently, I am planning to travel around
                        different northern countries like Iceland or Ireland so 
                        I can find a chilly and peaceful place to live.

                    <h1>Education</h1>

                    <p>
                        I am a graduate at the Technical University of Moldova
                        (TUM), having a bachelor's in robotics and studying
                        forward to getting a master's degree in computer
                        science.

                    <h1>Programming</h1>

                    <p>
                        I like different sorts of spheres of programming:
                        systems, embedded, AI & ML (reinforcement learning is
                        really cool!), front-end and back-end. I also know a
                        bunch of languages: Kotlin and Java, Python, C, Rust,
                        JS.. and a bit of C++ and Assembly. I would love to
                        learn Haskell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If someone asked me: "What is your favourite programming
                        language?" I would answer without hesitation: Rust. It
                        incorporates pretty much everything I love about
                        programming languages! Default immutability, the ability
                        to go low-level when needed, clean syntax (sometimes a
                        bit verbose), many more other things and a good
                        community.

                    <p>
                        I like graphic design & drawing. Although I'm not too
                        good at it, I sometimes draw stuff and it doesn't turn
                        out too bad (maybe it's even good). I also like taking
                        pictures (not of myself though), which you can tell by
                        my Instagram. Generally speaking, I like lots of things:
                        anime, cars, music (from trap metal to classic music),
                        typography, astronomy.. and more stuff which I cannot
                        remember right now.
